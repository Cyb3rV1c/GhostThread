# GhostThread


Description :

An advanced Windows shellcode injection tool leveraging APC (Asynchronous Procedure Call) injection to execute encrypted payloads within target processes. 
GhostThread uses dynamic API resolution via hash-based function lookups, enhancing its stealth and evasion capabilities against static and dynamic analysis tools. 
This tool supports position independent code and employs XOR decryption to securely unmask and execute payloads.
